# Coronavirus COVID-19 Tracker Android Application
This application displays the latest updates based on numbers from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

# Download APK & install: https://tinyurl.com/tsvjowr
As Google suspended all COVID-19 Tracking applications from PlayStore except the ones from WHO or an official governmental organization, that's why I had to build it as an APK to be installed manually and latest version will be always available on my GoogleDrive here https://tinyurl.com/tsvjowr
